*This project is dedicated to the soul of my beloved sister, who passed away during the time I was working on this project. Her memory and love continue to inspire me every day. This code carries a piece of my heart, written in her honor. May she rest in peace. 🌸*

Oh .. Hello there .. meow ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ

Well this is push swap project of the 42 school .. just sorting some numbers on something called stack .. nothing wow at this point~

It's just a simple algorithm project where we take numbers and make them go *brrrrrrrr* in the right order!

You can also have fun with my UwU tester ₍^. .^₎⟆ only by cloning my repo to your computer.

If you want a standard boring main, just replace `UwU.c` with `main.c` in the push_swap source files in the `Makefile`

You can still get less than 4500 operations for 500 numbers if you get rid of all optimize files beside `optimize_sort_three.c` but there will be no fun ..

##  **THE WARRIOR'S PATH**

The purpose of this documentation is to guide you. This journey will not be easy, warrior. You chose a tough path...

You see that hill of swords? Each blade represents a challenge you must overcome. The path is treacherous, soaked in the blood of those who came before you. But you... you have the chance to make it through.

**The question is: Do you have what it takes?**

You should absorb a lot of knowledge, understand a lot of concepts and learn a lot of algorithms. Get rid of a lot of memory leaks, face segfaults, battle linked list bugs, and realize that optimize files will not work as you expect.

**You must go through hell and come back alive.**

Trust me .. the demons will test your sanity. Those double linked list will drain your soul. But if you persist... if you endure... you might just survive this.

*Many have tried. Few have succeeded.*
